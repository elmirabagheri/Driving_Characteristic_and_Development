# Driving_Characteristic_and_Development
In this Project, the effect of powertrain, body style, driving character parameters and engine displacement of different vehicles on emissions and fuel consumption was comprehensively investigated. 
* Conventional Vehicles
* Hybrid Vehicle
* Dual Fuel Vehicle
# Craete Driving Cycles
19 real driving cycles in four distinct routes were created using:
* K-means
* PCA
